Initial commit, 4th try.

Status:
Database not being accessed. Cannot figure out why.
Nodemon is working.
No "problems" are found

Using the "todos" as a base-model. I plan to completely or at least slightly restructure the database.

Looking at 127.0.0.1:3000/skills
The database is located at: models/skill.js
	(proven by adding a line and refreshing the page)

Views/skills/index.ejs

Resolved issue:
View/skills/index.ejs: lines referring to t.skill were referring to t.skills
The S at the end was killing things. Once a test was done, we got better results.
Currently the s.skill ? done is not showing correctly.
